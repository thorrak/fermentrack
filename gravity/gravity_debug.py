# gravity_debug.py is designed to be a test suite to ensure that the packages for specific gravity support are installed
# and to assist with debugging anything that isn't working properly. The idea is that gravity support was added later
# in the development cycle of Fermentrack and therefore cannot be assumed to be working out of the box.
