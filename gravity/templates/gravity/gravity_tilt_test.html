    <h1>Debugging Tilt Support</h1>


    <h3>System Packages</h3>

    <p>
        Fermentrack relies on several applications being installed on the system at the same time as Fermentrack. If any
        of these packages are missing, it can impact the necessary Python packages from being installed or functioning
        as expected.
    </p>

    {% if has_apt %}
        {% if has_apt_packages %}
            <h4>All necessary system packages are installed</h4>
        {% else %}
            <h4 style="color: darkred">Several system packages are missing. </h4>
        {% endif %}{# has_apt_packages #}

        <table class="table table-hover">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Package Name</th>
                    <th>OK?</th>
                </tr>

                    <td>{{ test_result.package }}</td>
                    <td>{% if test_result.result %}Installed{% else %}Not Installed{% endif %}</td>

        {% if not has_apt_packages %}

            <p>
            Several of the system packages listed above are required for all of the Python packages to install. If you
            do not first install the missing system packages you may be unable to fix other errors that appear on this
            page. Thankfully, installing these missing packages is pretty simple. Information on how to resolve this
            can be found in the <a href="http://docs.fermentrack.com/en/dev/gravitysensors/tilt.html#fixing-missing-system-packages">Fermentrack documentation.</a>
            </p>
        {% endif %}{# has_apt_packages #}


    {% else %}
            <h4>Unable to locate the software necessary to check system packages</h4>
            <p>
                This test only works for systems that use apt/dpkg, like Raspbian, Debian, or Ubuntu. If you are running
                on another operating system, you're unfortunately on your own for this test.
            </p>
    {% endif %}{# has_apt #}




    <h3>Python Packages</h3>

    <p>
    Fermentrack is a Python-based application, and requires a number of Python packages to be installed and at the
    correct version in order for all of its features to work. That said - it is designed to fail (somewhat) gracefully,
    and as such if certain packages are missing only those features that rely on those packages (e.g. Tilt support) will
    stop working. This test checks to ensure that all packages required for Tilt support are installed and at the
    required version.
    </p>

    <p>
    {# TODO - Make this actually test the OS and hide the message for MacOS and Linux #}
    <b>Note - </b> The package list being tested below does not apply to installations on Windows.
    </p>

    {% if has_packaging %}

        {% if has_python_packages %}
            <h4>All necessary python packages are installed</h4>
        {% else %}
            <h4 style="color: darkred">Several python packages are missing. </h4>
        {% endif %}{# has_python_packages #}


        <table class="table table-hover">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Package Name</th>
                    <th>Required Version</th>
                    <th>Installed Version</th>
                    <th>OK?</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>

            {% for test_result in python_test_results %}
            <tr>
                <td>{{ test_result.package }}</td>
                <td>{{ test_result.required_version }}</td>
                <td>{{ test_result.installed_version }}</td>
                <td>{% if test_result.ok %}OK{% else %}Not OK{% endif %}</td>
            </tr>
            {% endfor %}
        </table>

        {% if not has_python_packages %}

            <p>
                One or more of the Python packages required for Fermentrack's Tilt support to function are either
                missing or at an incorrect version.
                {% if not has_apt_packages %}
                    This may be caused by missing system packages. Before proceeding, please ensure that all required
                    system packages (see the earlier test) are installed.
                {% endif %}
                The easiest way to resolve this is to trigger a manual refresh of the Python requirements. To do this,
                click the button below. If this does not resolve your missing packages check the
                <a href="{% url "get_app_log" "text" "upgrade" "stderr" %}">upgrade log</a> to see what is happening.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="{% url "trigger_requirements_reload" %}" class="btn btn-primary">Update/Install Missing Python Packages</a>
            </p>
        {% endif %}

    {% else %}
        <h4 style="color: darkred">Python 'packaging' module is not available - Test cannot run!</h4>
        <p>
            This is a fairly serious error, as it implies that your python packages are not being kept up-to-date.
            If there are missing system packages (above) resolve those before proceeding. Next, attempt a
            manual refresh (below) of the Python requirements to see if the 'packaging' module can be installed. If
            neither of these resolve this issue, check the
            <a href="{% url "get_app_log" "text" "upgrade" "stderr" %}">upgrade log</a> to see what is happening.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="{% url "trigger_requirements_reload" %}" class="btn btn-primary">Update/Install Missing Python Packages</a>
        </p>

    {% endif %}

    <h3>Redis Connectivity</h3>

    <p>
    Fermentrack uses Redis to store datapoints received from the Tilt for futher processing within Fermentrack. If
    Redis support isn't installed, the Redis server isn't running (or is otherwise inaccessible), or we cannot set or
    retrieve keys from Redis, then the Tilt support will not function.
    </p>

    <table class="table table-hover">
        <tr>
            <td>Redis Support Installed?</td>
            <td>{% if redis_installed %}Yes{% else %}Not Installed!{% endif %}</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Can Connect to Redis?</td>
            <td>{% if able_to_connect_to_redis %}Yes{% else %}Cannot connect!{% endif %}</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Can Set/Retrieve Keys?</td>
            <td>{% if redis_key_test %}Yes{% else %}Not able to set/retrieve keys!{% endif %}</td>
        </tr>
