<h1 class="page-header">Tilt Guided Calibration</h1>


    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
        Although Tilt devices seem to output specific gravity readings, they work by internally measuring the angle
        (tilt) of the device and applying an equation to convert this angle to the expected specific gravity. Although
        we do not have the ability to edit or calibrate this conversion equation directly, we can apply a correction
        factor to the readings it provides to add additional accuracy to the specific gravity we log.
    </p>

    <p>
        This process will guide you through creating sugar/water mixtures of known specific gravity and then seeing what
        specific gravity the Tilt reports from each. By the end of this process you will have collected 5 data points
        which Fermentrack will then use to derive your Tilt's conversion function. You will need a few pieces of
        equipment to complete this process - all of which are listed out below.
    </p>


    <h3>Supplies</h3>

    <p>In order to perform this guided calibration, you will need the following supplies:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>4 lbs (2 kg) White Table Sugar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>2 cup (500 ml) measuring cup (for mixing) </li>
        <li>2+ gallon (or 6+ liter) bucket (does not need to be sanitized)</li>
        <li>Tilt Hydrometer</li>
        <li>Gram scale</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Setup</h3>

    <p>
        One last thing before we begin --<br>
        Right now, you have a handful of existing calibration points. If you're sure these are still accurate, that's
        perfectly fine - more points help the accuracy of the calibration. If you aren't sure however, please return to
        the manage device screen and delete them before continuing. If any of these points have an identical
        expected gravity they will be deleted automatically.
    </p>
