# Legacy (PHP/Apache) Application Support

Unlike apps such as RaspberryPints and BrewPi-www which use [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) to serve webpages, Fermentrack uses [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/). If you wish to run applications other than Fermentrack on the same Raspberry Pi you will need to configure nginx to serve those applications instead of Apache.

Fermentrack-tools includes a script which can be used to install this support automatically. 


## Understanding Legacy Support

To support legacy applications, the fermentrack-tools script does the following:

* Install `php5-common`, `php5-cli`, and `php5-fpm` to allow Nginx to serve php files
* Disable `apache2` from launching at startup
* Create a new nginx configuration file serving webpages from `/var/www/html` on port 81

**Note** - Due to the port change mentioned above, any apps that were previously running at `http://<your-ip>/` will now be running at `http://<your-ip>:81/`




## Installation

Although fermentrack-tools offers a script to allow for fully automated installation of support for PHP/legacy apps, support can be installed manually as well.

### Automated Installation

To run the fully automated installation script, simply SSH into your Raspberry Pi and execute:

`curl -L install-legacy-support.fermentrack.com | sudo bash`

### Manual Installation

To manually install legacy app support, you will need to do the following as root:

1. Install PHP5 support - `apt-get install php5-common php5-cli php5-fpm`
2. Disable `apache2` from running at startup - `update-rc.d apache2 disable`
3. Disable any currently running instance of `apache2` - `service apache2 stop`
4. Install the appropriate configuration file to `nginx`. An example configuration file can be found [here](https://github.com/thorrak/fermentrack-tools/tree/master/nginx-configs), and must be installed in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`
5. Restart PHP5-FPM - `service php5-fpm restart`
6. Restart Nginx - `service nginx restart`


## Legacy BrewPi-www Installation Support

Although performing the above actions will allow brewpi-www to run alongside Fermentrack, doing so is not recommended.
