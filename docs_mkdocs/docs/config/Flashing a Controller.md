# Flashing a Controller

If your controller (Arduino, ESP8266, Spark, etc.) has not yet had the BrewPi firmware installed, you will need to install the firmware prior to it being set up in Fermentrack.

Please note, at this time Fermentrack does not yet support directly flashing firmware to controllers. Support is expected in v2 - please pay attention to the thread on HomeBrewTalk for more information.
