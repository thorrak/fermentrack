# Fermentrack and Arduino-based Controllers

Fermentrack currently supports Arduino-based controllers connected via Serial (USB).

By default, Fermentrack will detect the USB serial number associated with your Arduino when initially configured, and will use that - instead of the specified serial port - to connect. For more information, read the "About Serial Port Autodetection" note in the ["Guided Setup" instructions](../config/BrewPi Controller Setup.md#setting-up-a-serial-connected-controller).


## Setting Up an Arduino-based Controller in Fermentrack

There are two options for setting up a controller in Fermentrack - Guided Setup and Advanced (Manual) Setup.

[**Guided Setup**](../config/BrewPi Controller Setup.md#setting-up-a-serial-connected-controller) - Instructions are available [here](../config/BrewPi Controller Setup.md#setting-up-a-serial-connected-controller). When choosing the board type, select "Arduino (and compatible)" from the dropdown.

[**Manual Setup**](../config/Advanced Controller Setup.md) - Instructions are available [here](../config/Advanced Controller Setup.md).
