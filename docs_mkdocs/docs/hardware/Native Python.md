# Fermentrack and Fuscus (Native Python Controller)

As of now, serial connections are supported by Fermentrack, and therefore it is expected that Fuscus should be Fermentrack compatible. Fuscus support *has not been tested* and should be considered experimental.

Due to the nature of the serial ports used by Fuscus, the serial autodetection process cannot be used to set up a Fuscus-based controller. Connections to Fuscus can be set up using the "advanced" workflow and manually specifying the Fuscus serial port. 

Further down the development path are other features involving Fuscus such as direct installation and configuration management - though these are expected in v3 and beyond.
