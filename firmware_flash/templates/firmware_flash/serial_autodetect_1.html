                        Incorrectly flashing a controller can lead to the controller (and things connected to it) being
                        damaged or destroyed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please double check that you have selected the correct family and board type and have disconnected the
                        controller from any other equipment before proceeding. Do not disconnect power to the controller or
                        attempt to reset the controller during the flashing process.

        Fermentrack flashes all controllers via serial - including those you ultimately want to connect via WiFi. This
        script will help you determine which serial device to flash.
    </p>

    <p>
        All serial controllers have a system-generated device ID which is used to allow your system to connect to the
        device. Rather than have you search for this ID manually, we'll attempt to automatically detect the ID by
        scanning what devices are connected, having you connect the controller, and then rescanning to see what new
        devices popped up. Once we have the list we'll ask you to confirm the correct controller and then we'll
        get everything configured. It's like magic!
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you're ready to begin, make sure the controller you want to set up is <b>not</b> connected & click
        "Scan Devices" below.
