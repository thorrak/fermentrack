#BrewPi Django documentation

Look - I haven't written any documentation for this yet, but I figure everything has to start somewhere.

This is a pretty standard Django app for most intents and purposes. You'll need to create the database (manage.py migrate iirc) - I'm targeting SQLite due to the easy deployment, but nothing prevents using postgres or mysql if that's what you prefer. You'll also need to create a superuser (manage.py createsuperuser) if you want to use the admin. It's optional.

The last thing you'll need to do is create the /brewpi_django/secretsettings.py file. I've created an example of this file called /brewpi_django/secretsettings.py.example . It's basic, for now.

If you think about the main BrewPi project, you have three main components - BrewPi-www, BrewPi-script, and the BrewPi firmware. This project seeks to replace BrewPi-www, and uses a replacement for BrewPi-script (which is in a subdirectory of the same name). Using this instance of Brewpi-script is mandatory for this project to function.
