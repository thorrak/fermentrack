It interfaces with BrewPi controllers as well as specific gravity sensors like the Tilt and iSpindel in order to help you make better beer. Fermentrack is designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi, but can be used in most environments capable of running Python.\n\n\nBrewPi Support\n\n\nFermentrack is a complete replacement for the web interface used by BrewPi written in Python using the Django web framework. In addition to the features bundled with brewpi-www, Fermentrack provides an easy install process, simple flashing of both Arduino-based and ESP8266-based BrewPi controllers, and the ability to control multiple chambers at once. Fermentrack also supports features such as WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity to help reduce clutter in your brewery. \n\n\nSpecific Gravity Sensor Support\n\n\nTo help track your wort's progress on it's journey to become beer, Fermentrack supports multiple specific gravity \nsensors both on a standalone basis as well as in conjunction with BrewPi-based fermentation temperature controllers. \nCurrently, Fermentrack supports \nTilt Hydrometers\n and \n\niSpindel devices\n for automated gravity logging in addition to providing the \nability to log manual gravity readings taken with traditional hydrometers or refractometers. \n\n\nIncluded with Fermentrack\n\n\n\n\nFermentrack\n - The Django-based replacement for brewpi-www. Licensed under MIT license.\n\n\nbrewpi-script\n - Installed alongside Fermentrack is brewpi-script. Licensed under GPL v3.\n\n\nBrewPi Firmware (Various)\n - Fermentrack can be used to install various versions of the BrewPi firmware. Most of these are licensed under GPL v3, though other licenses may apply.\n\n\nOther Firmware (Various)\n - Fermentrack also can be used to install firmware such as iSpindel and BrewPiLess to compatible devices. Licenses may vary.\n\n\n\n\nOther components used in or bundled with Fermentrack may have their own licensing requirements. These components can be referenced \nhere\n.\n\n\nNew Features\n\n\nOne of the key reasons to write Fermentrack was to incorporate features that are missing in the official BrewPi web interface. The following are just some of the features that have been added:\n\n\n\n\nSingle Command Installation\n\n\nNative multi-chamber support\n\n\nCleaner, more intuitive controller setup\n\n\nIntegrated support for ESP8266-based controllers\n\n\nOfficial support for \"legacy\" controllers\n\n\nNative support (including mDNS autodetection) for WiFi controllers\n\n\nRobust device detection for serial controllers \n\n\nSupport for Tilt and iSpindel specific gravity sensors\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi Zero, Zero W, 2 B, or 3 /w Internet Connection\n\n\nFresh Raspbian install \n\n\n1GB of free space available\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started with Fermentrack\n\n\nGetting started\n with Fermentrack is incredibly easy!

You will be guided through the configuration process when you first connect to Fermentrack.

This account will enable you to configure devices, configure the Fermentrack application, and view brew logs.\n\n\nSetting up the user account is extremely straightforward:\n\n\n\n\nFrom the root Fermentrack page, click \"Continue to guided installation\"\n\n\nOn the next page, entering the following:\n\n\nUsername\n - The username used to log into Fermentrack\n\n\nPassword\n - The password for the user account\n\n\nEmail Address\n - Currently unused, but may potentially be used later\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \"Create new user account\"\n\n\nDone!\n\n\n\n\nYou're now ready to move on to configuring the site settings.\n\n\nSite Settings\n\n\nAfter configuring a user account, the next step is to configure Fermentrack.

Login will still be required to change temperature settings, configuration options, etc.\n\n\nTemperature format\n - The preferred (default) temperature format. Used when setting fermentation temperature profiles. Can be overridden per device.\n\n\nPreferred timezone\n - The preferred timezone you would like graphs displayed in. \nNote\n - All data is stored in UTC (GMT) - you are only selecting how the data will be \ndisplayed\n. Feel free to change this at any time with no issues. \n\n\nGit Update Type\n - Which releases you will be prompted to upgrade to. Can be set to \"tagged versions\" (which will generally be tested and stable), \"all commits\" which will include all new code releases, and \"None\".\n\n\n\n\nAll of these can be updated at any time by clicking on the \"gear\" icon in the upper right of any Fermentrack page.\n\n\nNotes for Advanced Users\n\n\nUser Accounts\n\n\nCurrently, Fermentrack has limited access control implemented, and is not yet designed for multiple user installations. This feature is planned for a later release - once it becomes available, different levels of access will be able to be specified on a per-user basis.\n\n\nIn the mean time if you need multiple user accounts they can be configured using the Django admin interface (accessible via the \"gear\" icon). Each account will need \"superuser\" access to be able to use the full functionality of Fermentrack. Again - please keep in mind - multiple user access is not officially supported. When access control functionality is implemented, any users created previously through this method will retain full access/control of Fermentrack.\n\n\nAdvanced Site Settings\n\n\nThere are a handful of additional site settings which are intended for advanced users and developers only. These settings can only be accessed via the Django admin. These settings include:\n\n\n\n\nAllow Git Branch Switching\n - Allows switching to a different git branch from within Fermentrack\n\n\nUser Has Completed Configuration\n - Determines if the user has completed the initial configuration workflow, or should be prompted to set Fermentrack up on next login\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, graph colors can be configured via the Django admin.
