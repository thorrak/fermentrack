Changelog
====================

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) because it was the first relatively standard format to pop up when I googled "changelog formats".


[2018-07-XX] - Gravity Refactoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added
---------------------

- DS18b20 sensors can now have temperature offsets added to each reading to correct for calibration errors
- ESP8266 controllers can now have their WiFi settings reset via the "manage sensor" web interface
- Control constants form now supports both "new" (OEM BrewPi) and "old" ("Legacy" branch) control constants
- Tilt hydrometers can now have their specific gravity readings calibrated
- "Heat/Cool State" will now be shown on temperature graphs
- Fermentrack logo added as favicon


Changed
---------------------

- The iSpindel endpoint can now be accessed at either /ispindel or /ispindle
- Specific gravity will now be shown on graphs with 3 decimal places
- Beer log format has been changed to add state information

Fixed
---------------------

- Removed constant LCD polling for "modern" controllers
- Gravity support will now be properly disabled when the correct flag is set at setup
- iSpindel devices that do not report all 'extras' will no longer throw errors when reporting gravity

- Support for in-app git branch switching
- Autodetection of serial devices
- Huey (delayed/scheduled task) support (currently unused)
- Controllers connected via serial can now have their serial port autodetected using the udev serial number
- Beer profiles are now displayed in graph form
- Firmware can now be flashed to new Arduino & ESP8266-based controllers from within the app
- Preferred timezone can now be selected for use throughout Fermentrack
- Beer log management (deletion/downloading)
- Added configuration options for graph line colors
- Graph lines can be toggled by clicking the icon in the legend
- Added support for specific gravity sensors

Changed
---------------------

- Inversion flag for installed devices is now shown on the "configure pins/sensors" page
- Form errors are now displayed on "configure pins/sensors" page
- Beer logs are no longer deleted along with the parent device (but they will become inaccessible from within Fermentrack)
- GitHub updates are no longer triggered automatically by visiting the update page, and must now be manually triggered by clicking a button
- The IP address of a BrewPiDevice is now cached, and can be used if mDNS stops working
- At end of a fermentation profile the controller will now be switched to beer constant mode
- All data points are now explicitly recorded in UTC
- Added icon to graph legend to display line color
- Updated to Django v1.11 (Long term support version)
- Changed from supporting Python 2 to Python 3


Fixed
---------------------

- Inversion state no longer improperly defaults
- Minimum graph size adjusted to account for smaller displays
- Changed on_delete behavior to allow deletion of fermentation controllers
- Git update check will now properly wait between checks if up to date
- GIT_UPDATE_TYPE of 'none' will now properly disable update checks
