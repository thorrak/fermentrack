"Push" Support
==============================

Although Fermentrack is focused on the "fermentation" phase of your brewing operation, Fermentrack is designed to
integrate with your brewing operation as a whole. To support the use of data collected by Fermentrack in other
applications, Fermentrack allows for data to be "pushed" on a periodic basis via HTTP requests (and will - in the
future - support pushing via TCP (sockets)).


Supported "Push" Targets
------------------------------

Fermentrack currently supports three push targets:

- **"Generic" Push Target** - Fermentrack's "native" push format - Pushes both specific gravity & temperature data
- **Brewer's Friend** - Fermentrack's "native" push format - Pushes both specific gravity & temperature data
- **Brewfather** - Fermentrack's "native" push format - Pushes both specific gravity & temperature data




Generic Push Target Format
******************************

The "generic" push target format is the one recommended for use by developers who are adding native Fermentrack
support to their apps. This format contains temperature/gravity data collected by Fermentrack for each available
specific gravity sensor and BrewPi controller.

This format is supported by the `Fermentrack Push Target app <http://github.com/thorrak/fermentrack_push_target>`__ for
testing/development purposes.

Brewer's Friend Support
***********************

Fermentrack supports pushing data from specific gravity sensors to `Brewer's Friend <https://www.brewersfriend.com/>`_ using the "Device Stream" API. To configure:


#. Log into Fermentrack and click the "gear" icon in the upper right
#. Click "Add Brewer's Friend Push Target" at the bottom of the page
#. Log into your Brewer's Friend acount and go to `Profile > Integrations <https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/profile/integrations>`_
#. Copy the API key listed at the top of the page in Brewer's Friend (the string of letters/numbers)
#. Within Fermentrack, paste the API key you just copied into the "Api key" field
#. Set the desired push frequency and select the gravity sensor from which you want to push data
#. Click "Add Push Target"

Within 60 seconds, Fermentrack will begin sending data from your gravity sensor to Brewer's Friend. This data can be seen on the `Device Settings <https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/profile/device_settings>`_ page. (*Note* - You may need to click "Show All" on the right of this page to see the data for newly added devices)


Brewfather Support
***********************

Fermentrack supports pushing data from specific gravity sensors to Brewfather using the "Custom Stream" API. To configure:

#. Log into Fermentrack and click the "gear" icon in the upper right
#. Click "Add Brewfather Push Target" at the bottom of the page
#. Log into your Brewfather acount and go to `Settings <https://web.brewfather.app/#/tabs/settings/settings>`_
#. At the bottom of the page, under "Power-ups" click the "switch" next to "Custom Stream"
#. Copy the Logging URL (starting with http and ending with a string of letters/numbers) listed under "Custom Stream"
#. Within Fermentrack, paste the Logging URL you just copied into the "Logging URL" field
#. Set the desired push frequency and select the gravity sensor from which you want to push data
#. Click "Add Push Target"

Within 60 seconds, Fermentrack will begin sending data from your gravity sensor to Brewfather. This data can be seen on the `Devices <https://web.brewfather.app/#/tabs/devices/devices>`_ page.

**NOTE** - If your gravity sensor is attached to a BrewPi controller, the temperature readings from that controller will be used instead of the ones from the gravity sensor.



Implementation Notes
------------------------------

Push support within Fermentrack is implemented through the use of a "helper script" which currently is launched once
every minute. The helper script polls the defined push targets to determine which (if any) are overdue for data to be
pushed, and - for those targets - then executes the push based on how those targets are configured. Fermentrack polls
Redis for the latest available data point for specific gravity sensors, and polls BrewPi controllers for the latest data
point directly. This data is then encoded based on the selected push format and sent downstream to the requested target.

Push requests are handled asynchronously. Due to the way that the polling script is implemented, push "frequencies" may
be up to one polling cycle (currently 1 minute) later than expected. For 1 minute push cycles, this means that the
actual frequency could be as high as 2 minutes.


Feedback
------------------------------

Push support was designed to support future applications that do not yet exist, and as such, may not be perfect for
*your* application. That said, feedback is always appreciated and welcome. Feel free to reach out (HBT forums,
GitHub, Reddit...) if you have something in mind that you'd like to integrate Fermentrack into, and don't think the
existing push options will quite work.
