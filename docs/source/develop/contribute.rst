Contributing to Fermentrack
==============================

Want to help? Great! There are a number of ways you can get involved in this project. To help you get started, some
areas in which you can contribute are listed below along with additional resources for getting started.


Reporting Bugs/Issues
----------------------

Found a bug or issue (or have a suggestion for how to improve)? Awesome!

The best way to reach out is to either open an issue on GitHub_ or discuss your issue or idea in the
HomeBrewTalk thread (or - ideally - both). Both of these are actively monitored, and will help to keep track of progress
towards a resolution.


Developing Fermentrack
-----------------------

Interested in helping develop Fermentrack (or improving its look & feel)? Fantastic - Fermentrack is an open source
project, and all help is welcome.

Fermentrack is a Python-based application which uses the Django framework. It is open source and is managed on GitHub.
To help you get started, take a look at the developer documentation located within :doc:`/develop/index`. After reading,
if you have questions don't hesitate to reach out. I do recommend reaching out (either on HomeBrewTalk or by raising an
issue on GitHub) prior to developing a feature that you ultimately would like merged back in.


Documenting Fermentrack
-------------------------------------

A project like Fermentrack is only as good as its documentation. Documentation for Fermentrack is (currently) written in
`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__ with an eye towards `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`__.
The source for the documentation is located in the ``docs/source`` folder in the Fermentrack repo on GitHub_.

If you are familiar with GitHub, pull requests that include documentation fixes are always welcome. If not, reach out on
GitHub or the HomeBrewTalk forums and we'll be happy to help get things updated.
