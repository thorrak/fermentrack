Developing Fermentrack

Interested in helping develop Fermentrack (or improving its look & feel)? Fantastic - Fermentrack is an open source
project, and all help is welcome.

Fermentrack is a Python-based application which uses the Django framework. It is open source and is managed on GitHub.
To help you get started, take a look at the developer documentation located within :doc:`/develop/index`. After reading,
if you have questions don't hesitate to reach out.


Documenting Fermentrack
-------------------------------------

A project like Fermentrack is only as good as its documentation. Documentation for Fermentrack is (currently) written in
`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__ with an eye towards `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`__.
The source for the documentation is located in the ``docs/source`` folder in the Fermentrack repo on GitHub_.

If you are familiar with GitHub, pull requests that include documentation fixes are always welcome. If not, reach out on
 GitHub or the HomeBrewTalk forums and we'll be happy to help get things updated.
