### Documenting Fermentrack

A project like Fermentrack is only as good as its documentation. Documentation for Fermentrack is (currently) written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) with an eye towards [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/). The documentation is part of the Fermentrack repo on GitHub.

If you are familiar with GitHub, pull requests that include documentation fixes are always welcome. If not, reach out on GitHub or the HomeBrewTalk forums and we'll be happy to help get things updated.
