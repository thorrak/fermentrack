Native Python (Fuscus) Controllers
=====================================

Fuscus_ is a project which implements the legacy (Arduino) BrewPi featureset directly on the Raspberry Pi with no need
for an external controller.

As of now, serial connections are supported by Fermentrack, and therefore it is expected that Fuscus should be
Fermentrack compatible. Fuscus support *has not been tested* and should be considered experimental.

Due to the nature of the serial ports used by Fuscus, the serial autodetection process cannot be used to set up a
Fuscus-based controller. Connections to Fuscus can be set up using the
["advanced" workflow](../config/Advanced Controller Setup.md) and manually specifying the Fuscus serial port.

Installation Notes
---------------------

**NOTE** - If setting up a Fuscus-installation manually, make sure to set "prefer_connecting_via_udev" to False. If
this is true, BrewPi-Script may either not connect or connect to the wrong device.

.. todo:: Convert the above to a callout

Further down the development path are other features involving Fuscus such as direct installation and configuration
management - though these are expected in v3 and beyond.
