Spark (OEM) Controllers
==========================

Currently, Fermentrack does not support Spark-based controllers. Support for Spark based controllers is planned, but
will be implemented at a much later date. Once implemented, Fermentrack will support controlling both legacy
(Arduino/Fuscus) and modern (Spark) controllers from the same installation.
