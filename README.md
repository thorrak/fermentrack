# Fermentrack

#### A replacement web interface for BrewPi

Fermentrack is a complete replacement for the web interface used by BrewPi written in Python using the Django web framework. It is designed to be used alongside a rewritten BrewPi-Script as well as ESP8266-based BrewPi controllers. Support for other BrewPi controllers (Arduino, Spark, and Fuscus) will be forthcoming. 

Fermentrack is currently intended to be installed on a fresh installation of Raspbian and will conflict with brewpi-www if installed on the same device. 


### Included with Fermentrack

* **Fermentrack** - The Django-based replacement for brewpi-www. Licensed under MIT license.
* **brewpi-script** - Installed alongside Fermentrack is brewpi-script. Licensed under GPL v3.
* **nginx** - A reverse proxy/webserver. Licensed under 2-Clause BSD-like license.
* **circusd** - A python-based process manager. Licensed under the Apache license, v2.0.
* **chaussette** - A wsgi server. 

## New Features

One of the key reasons to write Fermentrack was to incorporate features that are missing in the official BrewPi web interface. The following are just some of the features that have been added:

* Native multi-chamber support
* Cleaner, more intuitive controller setup
* Integrated support for ESP8266-based controllers
* Official support for "legacy" controllers
* Native support (including mDNS autodetection) for WiFi controllers

## Missing Features

At the moment, Fermentrack doesn't support 100% of the features of the official BrewPi web client. Some of these missing features (as well as the version they are expected to be added) include:

* Spark support (v3)
* Fuscus support (v3)
* Support for "modern" (non-legacy branch) controllers (v3)

A full table of controllers/expected hardware availability is available [in the documentation](docs/hardware/index.md).

## Installation & Documentation

Full documentation for Fermentrack (including complete installation instructions) is available at [https://thorrak.github.io/fermentrack/](https://thorrak.github.io/fermentrack/).

### Quick Installation Instructions

1. Set up your Raspberry Pi (Install Raspbian, enable SSH)
2. Log into your Raspberry Pi via the terminal or SSH and run `curl -L install.fermentrack.com | sudo bash`
3. Wait for the installation to complete (~45 mins) and log into Fermentrack 

## Requirements

* Raspberry Pi Zero, 2 B, or 3 /w Internet Connection
* Fresh Raspbian install (Lite/Pixel supported, Oct 2016 version or later)
* 1GB of free space available

**PLEASE NOTE** - Fermentrack is currently intended to be installed on a fresh installation of Raspbian. It is **not** intended to be installed alongside brewpi-www and will conflict with the apache server brewpi-www installs.
