brewpi-script
=============

This is a pared down version of the custom brewpi-script that was created for interfacing with ESP8266 BrewPi controllers. Brewpi-script logs the data, monitors the temperature profile and communicates with the BrewPi slave and the web server.

BrewPi-Script was originally created by Elco as part of the [BrewPi project](https://github.com/BrewPi/brewpi-script). 

This version has been modified by Thorrak & stone to add additional features, including being upgraded to become Python 3 compatible.
